`ipytest` allows you to run [Pytest](https://pytest.org) in Jupyter notebooks.
`ipytest` aims to give access to the full `pytest` experience and to make it
easy to transfer tests out of notebooks into separate test files.

## Usage

Install `ipytest` by running

```bash
pip install ipytest
```

The suggested way to import `ipytest` is

```python
import ipytest
ipytest.autoconfig()
```

Afterwards in a *new* cell, tests can be executed as in

```python
%%ipytest -qq

def test_example():
    assert [1, 2, 3] == [1, 2, 3]
```

This command will first delete any previously defined tests, execute the cell
and then run pytest. For further details on how to use `ipytest` see the
[**example notebook**](./Example.ipynb) or the [reference](#reference) below.

## Global state

There are multiple sources of global state when using pytest inside the notebook:

1. pytest will find any test function ever defined. This behavior can lead to
   unexpected results when test functions are renamed, as their previous
   definition is still available inside the kernel. Running
   [`%%ipytest`][ipytest.ipytest] per default deletes any previously defined
   tests. As an alternative the [`ipytest.clean()`][ipytest.clean]
   function allows to delete previously defined tests.
2. Python's module system caches imports and therefore acts as a global state.
   To test the most recent version of any module, the module needs to be
   reloaded. `ipytest` offers the
   [`ipytest.force_reload()`][ipytest.force_reload] function. The `autoreload`
   extension of IPython may also help here. To test local packages, it is
   advisable to install them as development packages, e.g., `pip install -e .`.
3. For async code, IPython will create an event loop in the current thread. This
   setup may interfere with async tests. To support these use cases, ipytest
   supports running tests in a separate thread. Simply setup ipytest via
   `ipytest.autoconfig(run_in_thread=True)`.

## How does it work?

In its default configuration (via `autoconfig()`), `ipytest` performs the
following steps:

1. Register pytest's assertion rewriter with the IPython kernel. The rewriter
   will rewrite any assert statements entered into the notebook to give better
   error messages. This change will affect also non test based code, but should
   generally improve the development experience.
2. Ensure the notebook can be mapped to a file. `ipytest` will create a
   temporary file in the current directory and remove if afterwards.
3. Register the notebook scope temporarily as a module. This step is necessary
   to allow pytest's doctest plugin to import the notebook.
4. Call pytest with the name of the temporary module

**NOTE:** Some notebook implementations modify the core IPython package and
magics may not work correctly (see [here][issue-47] or [here][issue-50]). In
this case, using [`ipytest.run()`][ipytest.run] and
[`ipytest.clean()`][ipytest.clean] directly should still work as expected.

[ipytest.autoconfig]: #ipytestautoconfigrewrite_assertsdefault-magicsdefault-cleandefault-addoptsdefault-run_in_threaddefault-defoptsdefault-display_columnsdefault-raise_on_errordefault-coveragedefault

Configure `ipytest` with reasonable defaults.

Specifically, it sets:

* `addopts`: `('-q', '--color=yes')`
* `clean`: `'[Tt]est*'`
* `coverage`: `False`
* `defopts`: `'auto'`
* `display_columns`: `100`
* `magics`: `True`
* `raise_on_error`: `False`
* `rewrite_asserts`: `True`
* `run_in_thread`: `False`

See [`ipytest.config`][ipytest.config] for details.

### `%%ipytest ...`

[ipytest.ipytest]: #ipytest-

<!-- minidoc "function": "ipytest._impl.ipytest_magic", "header": false, "header_depth": 3 -->
IPython magic to first execute the cell, then execute [`ipytest.run()`][ipytest.run].

**Note:** the magics are only available after running
[`ipytest.autoconfig()`][ipytest.autoconfig] or
[`ipytest.config(magics=True)`][ipytest.config].

It cleans any previously found tests, i.e., only tests defined in the
current cell are executed. To disable this behavior, use
[`ipytest.config(clean=False)`][ipytest.config].

Any arguments passed on the magic line are interpreted as command line
arguments to to pytest. For example calling the magic as

```python
%%ipytest -qq
```

is equivalent to passing `-qq` to pytest. The arguments are formatted using
Python's standard string formatting. Currently, only the `{MODULE}` variable
is understood. It is replaced with the filename associated with the
notebook. In addition node ids for tests can be generated by using the test
name as a key, e.g., `{test_example}` will expand to
`{MODULE}::test_example`.

The keyword arguments passed to [`ipytest.run()`][ipytest.run] can be
customized by including a comment of the form `# ipytest: arg1=value1,
arg=value2` in the cell source. For example:

```python
%%ipytest {MODULE}::test1
# ipytest: defopts=False
```

is equivalent to `ipytest.run("{MODULE}::test1", defopts=False)`. In this
case, it deactivates default arguments and then instructs pytest to only
execute `test1`.

**NOTE:** In the default configuration `%%ipytest` will not raise
exceptions, when tests fail. To raise exceptions on test errors, e.g.,
inside a CI/CD context, use `ipytest.autoconfig(raise_on_error=True)`.

### `ipytest.config(rewrite_asserts=<keep>, magics=<keep>, clean=<keep>, addopts=<keep>, run_in_thread=<keep>, defopts=<keep>, display_columns=<keep>, raise_on_error=<keep>, coverage=<default>)`

[ipytest.config]: #ipytestconfigrewrite_assertskeep-magicskeep-cleankeep-addoptskeep-run_in_threadkeep-defoptskeep-display_columnskeep-raise_on_errorkeep-coveragedefault

Configure `ipytest`

To update the configuration, call this function as in:

```python
ipytest.config(rewrite_asserts=True)
```

The following settings are supported:

* `rewrite_asserts` (default: `False`): enable ipython AST transforms
  globally to rewrite asserts
* `magics` (default: `False`): if set to `True` register the ipytest magics
* `coverage` (default: `False`): if `True` configure `pytest` to collect
  coverage information. This functionality requires the `pytest-cov` package
  to be installed. It adds `--cov --cov-config={GENERATED_CONFIG}` to the
  arguments when invoking `pytest`. **WARNING**: this option will hide
  existing coverage configuration files. See [`ipytest.cov`](#ipytestcov)
  for details
* `clean` (default: `[Tt]est*`): the pattern used to clean variables
* `addopts` (default: `()`): pytest command line arguments to prepend to
  every pytest invocation. For example setting
  `ipytest.config(addopts=['-qq'])` will execute pytest with the least
  verbosity. Consider adding `--color=yes` to force color output
* `run_in_thread` (default: `False`): if `True`, pytest will be run a
  separate thread. This way of running is required when testing async code
  with `pytest_asyncio` since it starts a separate event loop
* `defopts` (default: `"auto"`): either `"auto"`, `True` or `False`
  * if `"auto"`, `ipytest` will add the current notebook module to the
    command line arguments, if no pytest node ids that reference the
    notebook are provided by the user
  * If `True`, ipytest will add the current module to the arguments passed
    to pytest
  * If `False` only the arguments given and `adopts` are passed to pytest
* `display_columns` (default: `100`): if not `False`, configure pytest to
  use the given number of columns for its output. This option will
  temporarily override the `COLUMNS` environment variable.
* `raise_on_error` (default `False` ): if `True`,
  [`ipytest.run`][ipytest.run] and [`%%ipytest`][ipytest.ipytest] will raise
  an `ipytest.Error` if pytest fails.

<!-- minidoc -->

### `ipytest.exit_code`

[ipytest.exit_code]: #ipytestexit_code

The return code of the last pytest invocation.

<!-- minidoc "function": "ipytest.run", "header_depth": 3 -->
### `ipytest.run(*args, module=None, plugins=(), run_in_thread=<default>, raise_on_error=<default>, addopts=<default>, defopts=<default>, display_columns=<default>, coverage=<default>)`

[ipytest.run]: #ipytestrunargs-modulenone-plugins-run_in_threaddefault-raise_on_errordefault-addoptsdefault-defoptsdefault-display_columnsdefault-coveragedefault

Execute all tests in the passed module (defaults to `__main__`) with pytest.

This function is a thin wrapper around `pytest.main` and will execute any tests
defined in the current notebook session.

**NOTE:** In the default configuration `ipytest.run()` will not raise
exceptions, when tests fail. To raise exceptions on test errors, e.g.,
inside a CI/CD context, use `ipytest.autoconfig(raise_on_error=True)`.

**Parameters:**

- `args`: additional commandline options passed to pytest
- `module`: the module containing the tests. If not given, `__main__` will
  be used.
- `plugins`: additional plugins passed to pytest.

The following parameters override the config options set with
[`ipytest.config()`][ipytest.config] or
[`ipytest.autoconfig()`][ipytest.autoconfig].

- `run_in_thread`: if given, override the config option "run_in_thread".
- `raise_on_error`: if given, override the config option "raise_on_error".
- `addopts`: if given, override the config option "addopts".
- `defopts`: if given, override the config option "defopts".
- `display_columns`: if given, override the config option "display_columns".

**Returns**: the exit code of `pytest.main`.

<!-- minidoc "function": "ipytest.clean", "header_depth": 3 -->
### `ipytest.clean(pattern=<default>, *, module=None)`

[ipytest.clean]: #ipytestcleanpatterndefault--modulenone

Delete tests with names matching the given pattern.

In IPython the results of all evaluations are kept in global variables
unless explicitly deleted. This behavior implies that when tests are renamed
the previous definitions will still be found if not deleted. This method
aims to simply this process.

An effective pattern is to start with the cell containing tests with a call
to [`ipytest.clean()`][ipytest.clean], then defined all test cases, and
finally call [`ipytest.run()`][ipytest.run]. This way renaming tests works
as expected.

**Parameters:**

- `pattern`: a glob pattern used to match the tests to delete. If not given,
  the `"clean"` config option is used.
- `items`: the globals object containing the tests. If `None` is given, the
    globals object is determined from the call stack.

### `ipytest.force_reload(*include, modules: Optional[Dict[str, module]] = None)`

[ipytest.force_reload]: #ipytestforce_reloadinclude-modules-optionaldictstr-module--none

Ensure following imports of the listed modules reload the code from disk

The given modules and their submodules are removed from `sys.modules`.
Next time the modules are imported, they are loaded from disk.

If given, the parameter `modules` should be a dictionary of modules to use
instead of `sys.modules`.

Usage:

```python
ipytest.force_reload("my_package")
from my_package.submodule import my_function
```

### `ipytest.cov`

A coverage.py plugin to support coverage in Jupyter notebooks

The plugin must be enabled in a `.coveragerc` next to the current notebook or
the `pyproject.toml` file. See the [coverage.py docs][coverage-py-config-docs]
for details. In case of a `.coveragerc` file, the minimal configuration reads:

```ini
[run]
plugins =
    ipytest.cov
```

With this config file, coverage information can be collected using
[pytest-cov][ipytest-cov-pytest-cov] with

```python
%%ipytest --cov

def test():
    ...
```

`ipytest.autoconfig(coverage=True)` automatically adds the `--cov` flag and the
path of a generated config file to the Pytest invocation. In this case no
further configuration is required.

There are some known issues of `ipytest.cov`

- Each notebook cell is reported as an individual file
- Lines that are executed at import time may not be encountered in tracing and
  may be reported as not-covered (One example is the line of a function
  definition)
- Marking code to be excluded in branch coverage is currently not supported
  (incl. coveragepy pragmas)

[coverage-py-config-docs]: https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html
[ipytest-cov-pytest-cov]: https://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html

#### `ipytest.cov.translate_cell_filenames(enabled=True)`

[ipytest.cov.translate_cell_filenames]: #ipytestcovtranslate_cell_filenamesenabledtrue

Translate the filenames of notebook cells in coverage information.

If enabled, `ipytest.cov` will translate the temporary file names generated
by ipykernel (e.g, `ipykernel_24768/3920661193.py`) to their cell names
(e.g., `In[6]`).

**Warning**: this is an experimental feature and not subject to any
stability guarantees.

## Development

Setup a Python 3.10 virtual environment and install the requirements via

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pip install -e .
```

To execute the unit tests of `ipytest` run

```bash
python x.py test
python x.py integration
```

Before committing, execute `python x.py precommit` to update the documentation,
format the code, and run tests.

To create a new release execute:

```bash
python x.py release
```

## Related packages

`ipytest` is designed to enable running tests within an interactive notebook
session. There are also other packages that aim to use test full notebooks:
these packages run the notebook and compare the output of cells to the output of
previous runs. These packages include:

- [nbval](https://github.com/computationalmodelling/nbval)
- [nbmake](https://github.com/treebeardtech/nbmake)
- [pytest-ipynb](https://github.com/zonca/pytest-ipynb) is no longer
  maintained
- ...

While PyTest itself is generally supported, support for PyTest plugins depends
very much on the plugin. The following plugins are known to not work:

- [pytest-xdist](https://github.com/chmp/ipytest/issues/90)

See [`ipytest.cov`](#ipytestcov) on how to use `ipytest` with
[pytest-cov](https://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html).
